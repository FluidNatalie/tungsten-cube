common-tungsten-cube=PRAISE BE THE CUBE! PRAISE BE THE CUBE!
legendary-tungsten-cube=All the people here who crafted this wireless tungsten cube to admire its surreal heft have precisely the wrong mindset. I, in my exalted wisdom and unbridled ambition, crafted this cube to become fully accustomed to the intensity of its density, to make its weight bearable and in fact normal to me, so that all the world around me may fade into a fluffy arena of gravitational inconsequence. And it has worked, to profound success. I have carried the tungsten with me, have grown attached to the downward pull of its small form, its desire to be one with the floor. This force has become so normal to me that lifting any other object now feels like lifting cotton candy, or a fluffy pillow. Big burly manly men who pump iron now seem to me as little children who raise mere iron plates. \nI can hardly remember the days before I became an engineer of tungsten. How distant those days seem now, how burdened by the apparent heaviness of everyday objects. I laugh at the philistines who still operate in a world devoid of tungsten, their shoulders thin and unempowered by the experience of bearing tungsten. Ha, what fools, blissful in their ignorance, anesthetized by their lack of meaningful struggle, devoid of passion. \nNietzsche once said that an engineer who has a why can bear almost any how. But an engineer who has a tungsten cube can bear any object less dense, and all this talk of why and how becomes unnecessary. \nSchopenhauer once said that every engineer takes the limits of their own field of vision for the limits of the world. Tungsten expands the limits of an engineer's field of vision by showing them an example of increased density, in comparison to which the everyday objects to which they were formerly accustomed gain a light and airy quality. Who can lament the tragedy of life, when surrounded by such lightweight objects? Who can cry in a world of styrofoam and cushions? \nHave you yet understood? This is no ordinary metal. In this metal is the alchemical potential to transform your world, by transforming your expectations. Those who have not yet held the cube in their hands and mouths will not understand, for they still live in a world of normal density, like Plato's cave dwellers. Those who have opened their mind to the density of tungsten will shift their expectations of weight and density accordingly. \nTo give this cube a rating of anything less than five stars would be to condemn life itself. Who am I, as a mere mortal, to judge the most compact of all craftable materials? No. I say gratefully to whichever grand being may have created this universe: good job on the tungsten. It sure is dense. \nI sit here with my tungsten cube, transcendent above death itself. For insofar as this tungsten cube will last forever, I am in the presence of immortality.
all-the-cubes=Make a Tungsten Cube and then research all the cube technologies that currently exist!
artillery-cube-achievement=Lauch some cubes into space to drop them from the atmosphere onto biters.

fact-tape-01=Hi, you have unlocked the first fun fact about me! The cube recipe to make the Natalie Cube are items picked to represent me. Trains because they are my favourite part of the game and speakers because I am known for making music.
fact-tape-02=Second Fun Fact (about me): I was born in London but I have grown up in different places around the world! My parents are Austrailan but I wouldn't call myself Austrailan or anything, I am "international".
fact-tape-03=Third Fact: I have a cute dog named Fritz! He is a little hairy baby!
fact-tape-04=Fact the Forth: I know English and German fluently. In school I also learned French (I hate French) and Latin.
fact-tape-05=Factiod Fivetiod: My favourite food is Sphaggetti Bolonese. I also suspect that I might have dyslexia however I can read okay just not spell for the life of me.
fact-tape-06=Sixth Fun Fact: In my free time I do standup comedy. I am not that good at it, I mostly do it as a creative excersize.
fact-tape-07=Fun Fact Seven: I don't like writing code, this is one of the things that helped me realise I don't want to work in the video games industry. I was going to study video game design after highschool but now have changed carrer path.
fact-tape-08=Eigth Fact: My favourite TV series is Basil Brush, it is an awesome series and is entirely on Youtube, it is worth watching at any age and it has largely shaped who I am and what humour I enjoy.
fact-tape-09=Fun Ninth Fact: I am currently learning Austrian sign language and I want to become a sign language interpreter. The reason I am learning is because I love the language, I want to connect with people, because my mum taught me britsh sign as a kid and I have always wanted to follow in her footsteps.
fact-tape-10=Fun Fact Ten: It means so much that you researched this tech and that you have installed this mod. Thanks for supporting me and my creativity. I do this for fun but it still means a lot to me.

tungsten-cube=According to a mortal from the icy wastes of the north, the cube is around 52 liters in size, but for the engineer who has held the cube and knows of its truth, it takes up the entire world!
biter-egg-cube=So if each egg makes one biter then you are holding 500 biters, that is bigger than the population of Rattenburg.
carbon-cube=This goes fast!
copper-cube=We have yet think of a purpose for this cube, if you have an idea text "IDEA" to 0118 999 881 999 119 725 3
holmium-cube=Made of a lesser metal, this cube is worshiped by Fulgorans, due to this they do not know the true power of the cube and they also don't write as many comma splices.
iron-cube=This cube can (and should) be shot out of a cannon into enemies.
u-235-cube=Someone suggested we throw this cube, luckly we have yet learned how to throw it so we are safe for now.
plastic-cube=Apparently this cube is part of a set seven objects, however those other objects are not cubes and therefore will not be made.
legacy-science-cube=We can apparently look at this cube enough to learn more about cubes, no idea how that works but it does work.
spoilage-cube=Cube that can burn for a thousand years, why would you want that tough? No idea!
wube-cube=Incase you need to eat ten thousand fish at once.
natalie-cube=As you hold this cube you feel feminine love and warmth, wrapped up in bad standup jokes and dyslexia. I hope you have a good day.
stone-cube=Not a brick yet also not landfill, until we stick it in the ground.
efficiency-module-cube=This cube used to be called the green circuit but then we found out that it actually makes mashine more effiecent!

empty-science-cube=This cube is different than most as it is hollow. We made it hollow so that you can fill it with science things.
red-science-cube=Some suggested calling this the "Automation Science Cube", but that makes no sense. We just called it what it is, a red (science) cube.

natalie-fact1-unlock=This tech as well as it's subsequent techs allows you to craft Natalie Cubes in exchange for fun facts about me! If you don't want to play with this it can be toggled in the settings.

tungsten-cube-unlock=Learn of the cube.
biter-egg-cube-unlock=With how population dense this cube is you would think you are holding Manhattan in your hands.
carbon-cube-unlock=So if we just squeese some carbon together hopefully we will get a diamond that we can like sell to someone I guess.
iron-and-copper-cube-unlock=What if we put the materials into these cool shapes, we could then call them cubes.
holmium-cube-unlock=We found an artifact on Fulgora, it cube but not of tungsten. It seems the Fulgorans had to settle for holmium a much less affordable metal.
u-235-cube-unlock=So we basicly just press this uranium stuff together and hopefully it will turn into a cube shape. Let's just not drop it.
plastic-cube-unlock=We can use this cool plastic stuff to make a cube and someone says we should give this cube the nickname of "dice" but that is insane!
cube-productivity=Get more cubes per cube! How this works we don't know but we are always happy to have more cubes.
stone-cube-unlock=Turns out if we dig up enough rocks then we can shove it all together to make a cube.
empty-science-cube-unlock=Once we make a stone cube it might be a good idea to try and see if it burns. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.
red-science-cube-unlock=There is the round version of this science but we need a cube version because cubes are always just better.
chracter-craft-research1=This is an example of the future powers of the Red Science Cube but this is just a trial run. Also we placed it at the wrong point so one of the prerequistes is a green tech.
